The late bedtime could contribute to sleep deprivation, which can exacerbate feelings of depression and lead to increased stress.

It might be beneficial to explore strategies for improving sleep hygiene, such as establishing a regular sleep schedule, creating a calming bedtime routine, and addressing any underlying stressors.
